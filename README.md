# Islandora Microservices Deployment

This repository contains scripts and configuration files to deploy Islandora microservices.

Most of the components are taken directly from the [Lehigh University Libraries docker builds repository](https://github.com/lehigh-university-libraries/docker-builds).

You can build all the images using the `build_images.sh` script. I've also included a docker-compose for quickly spinning them all up locally for testing.
